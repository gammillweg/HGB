200503 create HGB repository with initial files

The repository will change in time, So this is for anyone that finds it
prior to my fixes.

1) HGBArticle.htm

I tired to publish the article: HGBArticle.htm on Code Project; but it
was rejected as not ready for CP publication. (They were
correct to reject it.)  So, accept the fact it is not ready for you
yet; but you can deal with it.  HGBArticle.htm will give you a little
idea of what HGB is and will do.

2) 2Rings.png, 49Rings.png, defaultStartup.png, VertexOrder.png

The images show what HGB looks like on a emulated Android phone

3) HGBClasses.zip

All the HGB Classes in a zip file

4) HGBExample.zip

The code for a Android Studio app which is displayed in the images
above.  As stated in the article: I lay no claim to being a good
Android programmer; but the app works!  (Read the Article)

5) java class code for HGB

All the classes of HGB

------------------------------------------------

My goal, is to turn HGB into a true Java (jar) library with documentation
on how to use it.  BUT, as stated in the htm article, I am approaching 80
and I am not sure I am up to the task.  We shall see.

OF COURSE... if a hexagon game board generator interests you, and you
would like to join my effort.  Please email me at gammillweg@centurylink.net.
